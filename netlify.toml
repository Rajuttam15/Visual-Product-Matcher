# This file configures Netlify for both local dev and live deployment.
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
```

This file tells Netlify three things:
* `command = "npm run build"`: How to build your site.
* `publish = "dist"`: Which folder to deploy.
* `functions = "netlify/functions"`: **Where to find your serverless function.** (This is the most important line for fixing your error).

### **Step 2: Verify Your Local Setup**

Make sure these two things are still correct from the previous steps:

1.  **Function File**: Confirm you have the file `netlify/functions/imagga.js`.
2.  **Environment File**: Confirm you have the `.env` file in your root folder with your API key inside it.

### **Step 3: Test Locally with `netlify dev`**

Now, we will test it locally again.

1.  Open your terminal in the project folder.
2.  Run the command:
    ```bash
    netlify dev
    ```
3.  Open the local URL it gives you (e.g., `http://localhost:8888`).
4.  Test the file upload and URL search again.

With the `netlify.toml` file in place, the `404 Not Found` error should now be gone, and your API calls should work correctly.

### **Step 4: Deploy the Final Version**

Once you see it working locally, you are ready to deploy.

1.  **Push all changes to GitHub**. This includes your new `netlify.toml` file.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: Add netlify.toml to configure functions"
    git push
